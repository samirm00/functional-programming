// Think functionally 

// Problem one : 
/*
    Let us see we have an e-commerce site, the user can fill his shopping card details 
    and then click on Pay button. In this example the user shouldn't be able to click twice 
    otherwise, he will pay billed several times.

    How can we solve this problem?
