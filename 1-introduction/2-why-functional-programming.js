    Why functional programming? 
    ==========================

    Functional programming help us to write a code with the following characteristics:

    1- Modular : FP help us to dived our code to independent functions, join togethers
    to create programs.
    
    2- Understandable : The code written in FP tend to be shorter, cleaner and easier to understand.

    3- Testable : functions can be tested  on their own.
    
    4- Reusable : Functions can be reused in different programs.

    5- extensible : Functional code is free from side effects, which means you
    can understand the objective of a function by studying it without having to 
    consider the rest of the program and makes it easy to add more functions if needed.

    However :
    Some FP solutions are actually tricky, and  If you aren't careful, your code may 
    become write-only and practically impossible to maintain; there goes understandable,
    extensible, and reusable out the door!
